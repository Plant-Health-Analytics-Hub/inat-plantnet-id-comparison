KEY NOTE: need to calculate one tail values for p-values when prediction has a direction

#####
Hypothesis 1: Computer vision tool produces less accurate results with plants that are outsiders
Prediction 1a: reduced accuracy for outsiders with more precise location

accuracy|outsider ~ 1 / location precision

Prediction 1b: increased accuracy for natives with more precise location

accuracy|native ~ location precision

Model:
accuracy ~ nativeStatus * locationPrecision * toolType
NOTE: potential df issue here
NOTE: use most current time point

#####
Hypothesis 2: Computer vision tools with larger user base should be more accurate and improve more over time
Prediction 2a: iNaturalist is more accurate than PlantNet

accuracy iNaturalist > accuracy PlantNet

Prediction 2b: accuracy increases over time

accuracy time_2 > accuracy time_1

Model:
accuracy ~ toolType * time + random(locationPrecision)

#####
Hypothesis 3: Accuracy is higher among more conspicuous plant families
Prediction 3a: Poaceae accuracy is lower than Asteraceae

accuracy Poaceae < accuracy Asteraceae

Model:
accuracy ~ family * toolType + random(locationPrecision)
NOTE: use most current time point

#####
Hypothesis 4: observations with a complete plant perform better than observations with plant parts
Prediction 4a: whole plant accuracy higher than plant parts

accuracy whole plant > accuracy plant parts

Prediction 4b: flower picture accuracy should be greater than leaf accuracy

accuracy flower > accuracy leaf

Model:
accuracy ~ plantParts * toolType + random(locationPrecision)
NOTE: use most current time point
NOTE: could group into whole plants, and plant parts, then run a separate model for flowers versus leaves
NOTE: may be limited by dfs here

#####
Hypothesis 5: are species of old introductions accurately identified?
Prediction 5a: accuracy of old introductions equivalent to native species accuracy

accuracy old introductions = accuracy native species

Model:
accuracy ~ nativeStatus
NOTE: not sure which ones are old introductions or not

##### Questions
Question 6: which taxonomic levels have higher accuracy?
Question 6a: how do these results vary by location?

Model:
NEED TO PONDER

Question 7: which species is most accurately identified?
